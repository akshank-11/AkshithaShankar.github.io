								<h1>Strategic IT Prioritization at Volkswagen</h1>
								<p style="font-style: normal; text-align: left;">
									Volkswagen, renowned for its innovation, is proactively diversifying its product offerings to align with emerging trends, such as mid-sized SUVs and special-purpose vehicles. As part of this strategy, the NRG Program has been launched to drive unprecedented growth for Volkswagen of America (VWoA). A key focus of the program is to establish prioritized high-level business goals, ensuring that the company's initiatives are strategically aligned with the future market demands.									
									<br><br>
									To address rising IT costs and inefficiencies, Volkswagen of America (VWoA) established the BPTO department, with Matulovic leading the initiative alongside a Project Management Office (PMO). Their efforts successfully realigned projects to stay within budget and timelines. This led to the implementation of a structured project prioritization process involving the Executive Leadership Team (ELT), PMO, IT Steering Committee, and the Digital Business Committee (DBC). However, limited funding later raised concerns about the overall effectiveness of the initiative.									
									<br><br>
									To what extent is the new project selection process deemed effective and indispensable? What strategic rationale underlies the allocation of $16 million in IT-controlled expenditures at Volkswagen?

								<h1>Cybersecurity Transformation Strategy</h1>
								<p style="font-style: normal; text-align: left;">
									SSR Inc. is new firm formed from a merger of three distinct companies each specializing in a different sector. Despite the success of the organization, they initially struggled to implement an IT department. Since, they have continued a solid position in their industry and have organized their IT systems sufficiently.
									<br><br>
									The security implementation process included a few gaps in their overall cybersecurity program which led to a ransomware hack compromising their systems, data, and daily operations.
									<br><br>
									How can SSR Inc. enhance their security protocols to create a more robust cybersecurity infrastructure and business environment?

								<h1>Incident Response Strategy at Boeing</h1>
								<p style="font-style: normal; text-align: left;">
									Boeing is a prominent aerospace company known for its high-quality products. The Boeing 737 MAX, part of the fourth generation of the Boeing 737 family, aimed to improve fuel efficiency and extend the range compared to its predecessors.
									<br><br>
									On October 29, 2018, Lion Air Flight 610, a Boeing 737 MAX 8 en route from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang, experienced technical issues soon after departing Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. The plane subsequently went into a steep dive and crashed into the Java Sea about 13 minutes after takeoff, prompting an inquiry into IT Governance and Control procedures.
									<br><br>
									What measures should Boeing implement to enhance incidents response, rebuild public confidence, and prevent a recurrence of such incidents?
